# ANALYSIS-REPORT-ON-GLOBAL-HEALTH-STATISTICS-FROM-2000-TO-2024---Kelechi-Uwanaka
This analysis was done with Power Bi and it is an analysis report on Global Health Statistics from 2000 to 2024. It examines key metrics like mortality rate, recovery rate, population income, and prevalence rate. The data is visualized through line charts, pie charts, and bar graphs. The report covers incidence and prevalence rates over time, mortality by disease, population affected by gender, healthcare access, and vaccine availability improvements. Overall, the dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of global health trends and statistics over 24 years, covering factors like disease incidence, mortality, treatment, and population impact.

TOOLS USED:

Visualizations such as line charts, pie charts, and bar graphs to display the data
Numerical data and statistics to quantify the various health metrics 
KEY INSIGHTS

The following are my observations based on the findings from the analysis.

1. The incident rate by the year shows that 2003 has the highest incident rate with 305.1k while 2013 recorded the lowest incident rate.

2. The prevalence rate by the country affected shows Russia as the country with the highest prevalence rate with 509.06k followed by Mexico, South Africa, Nigeria, and Germany.

3. The Mortality rate by the disease shows Cancer as the disease with the highest mortality rate 254.89k followed by COVID-19, zika disease, dengue disease, and Cholera as the top 5 diseases with a high mortality rate.

4. The percentage of the population affected by the disease by gender shows the male gender as the most affected at 33.4%, the female affected at 33.3% and the other genders at 33.29%.

5. the improvement rate in 5 years by the availability of the vaccine shows that 2501.82k improved with vaccine availability while 2500.77k did not improve with vaccination.

6. Healthcare access by the disease category shows that metabolic disease has more access to healthcare, followed by Parasitic disease, then genetic disease, autoimmune disease and last is the viral disease all these are the top 5 disease categories with access to healthcare.

7. The recovery rate by the treatment given shows that Surgery has the highest recovery rate with 25.06% followed by therapy, vaccination, and medication treatment being the least recorded recovery rate.

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. The high prevalence rates in countries like Russia, Mexico, and South Africa suggest a need for targeted public health interventions in these regions. Focus on increasing awareness and access to treatment to reduce the disease burden.

2. Given that cancer has the highest mortality rate, I recommend prioritizing research and treatment funding for cancer care. Additionally, strengthens prevention and response strategies for diseases like COVID-19, Zika, Dengue, and Cholera.

3. Since the high male predominance in disease prevalence, I recommend focusing on gender-specific health initiatives to address the unique needs of both males and females. Ensure equal access to healthcare for all genders to reduce disparities.

4. The slight improvement in regions with vaccine availability suggests that increasing vaccine access can lead to better health outcomes. so, I recommend focusing on expanding vaccine distribution to improve public health even further.

5. Metabolic diseases having the highest healthcare access, I recommend improved healthcare infrastructure for categories with lower access, such as viral and autoimmune diseases, to ensure more equitable care across all disease categories.

6. The recovery rates have been quite similar across treatment types, I recommend focusing on improving the effectiveness of all treatment methods, with particular attention to optimizing vaccination and therapy as cost-effective alternatives.

7. As multiple diseases show a high prevalence and mortality rate, integrating prevention programs to address several diseases simultaneously, particularly in high-risk regions is important and recommended.

8. Raise awareness about the importance of early detection and treatment, particularly for diseases with lower healthcare access, to improve overall health outcomes.

9. Given the varying disease prevalence and mortality rates being high, I recommend enhancing monitoring systems to track trends and respond quickly to emerging health threats.
